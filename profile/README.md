KEEP SOLUTIONS is a company whose mission is to provide advanced solutions for information management and digital preservation.

Our approach consists in providing software and services to allow our customers to make a more efficient management of their information assets.

The company started its activity in 2008, having acquired the status of academic spin-off of the University of Minho, for being a business initiative with strong bonds with research centres and departments from this institution.

Our clients are mostly found in the public sector, more specifically in the areas related to archives, libraries and museums.

We invest in the continuous development of innovative solutions. To support that, we remain active in the production of scientific knowledge while engaging in large-scale R&D projects in cooperation with national and international institutions.
